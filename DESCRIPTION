Title: Weighting for Covariate Balance in Observational Studies
Version: 0.5.1.9000
Author: Noah Greifer [aut, cre]
Maintainer: Noah Greifer <noah.greifer@gmail.com>
Description: Generates weights to form equivalent groups in observational studies with point or longitudinal treatments by easing and extending the functionality of the R packages 'twang' for generalized boosted modeling, 'CBPS' for covariate balancing propensity score weighting, 'ebal' for entropy balancing, 'optweight' for optimization-based weights, 'ATE' for empirical balancing calibration weighting, and 'SuperLearner' for stacked machine learning-based propensity scores. Also allows for assessment of weights and checking of covariate balance by interfacing directly with 'cobalt'.
